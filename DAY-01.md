# Day 1 – DevOps Mindset & Toolchain

## What I Learned
- DevOps is about culture, automation, and collaboration.
- The 8 stages of the DevOps lifecycle: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor.

## Reflection
DevOps is not a job title or a single tool. It’s a culture that bridges: DevOps is not a job title or a single tool. It’s a culture that bridges: Development (writing code)
Operations (running & maintaining systems)Development (writing code)

👉 Real-world analogy:
Think of building a car.

Old way: Designers build it → throw it over the wall to mechanics → mechanics struggle to fix it.
DevOps way: Designers + mechanics collaborate during design, test prototypes daily, and improve together.
